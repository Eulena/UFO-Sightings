# UFO Sightings

The objective of this homework was to create an HTML webpage that displays a dynamic table based on the UFO Sightings dataset provided to us students. The final output of the webpage will allow users to search through the table for specific date related to UFO Sightings. To accomplish this, I had to use the UFO dataset provided in JavaScript format and write a code that would append a table to the webpage and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting, ultimately showing columns namely: date/time, city, state, country, and shape. In addition, I had to use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `__date/time__` column to find rows that will match the user input. Furthermore, CSS and Bootstrap were used to create the styling of the webpage.
